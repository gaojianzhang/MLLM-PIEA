Here you'll find the implementation for extracting and summarizing personality traits, along with code for generating the training and test data. The included JSON files contain the complete training and test sets as referenced in our paper.

The training script can be found in the appendix of our paper.

Our paper is accepted but has not yet been published.

The files of personality traits and best model checkpoint are available on Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/datasets/kirito32767/MLLM-PIEA
